# Contact Cloud (zoomphonebook)

**Contact Cloud** is a Rust-designed CLI application designed for use with online applications such as Zoom and functions as a digital phonebook to maintain contacts within the confines of the command line.



# Use
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS!**

Currently, the application is able to save Zoom contacts as JSONs based on user input. 

To create new use, use the command **phonebook create** - and the program should prompt you to create a new contact while you fill in the appropriate fields.

To view all contact files within the directory, use the command **phonebook show**.

# Future Plans
After the development of the primary phonebook feature, this project will be connected to the Twillio API to function alongside a reminder system. This system will be hosted on a continuous web-server - tested on a Raspberry Pi, with plans to move it onto an AWS application.
